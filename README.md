# :warning: DEPRECATED :warning:

This repository is deprecated in favor of [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate).

The new version uses latest stack on the front-end (NextJS, ReactJS, MobX). The split between front and back-end code is more obvious and the UI has been fully rewritten.

Also, additional functionalities were added in order to customize the application to the landlords needs.

Developer wise [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate) should be easier to enhance and to maintain.

## Loca
